	- Ingredients: Sugar, Orange, Water, Lime, Corn
	- Outcome: Dough, Soft Dough, Fermented Dough, Hot Biscuit, Packaged Biscuit
	- Loss Types: “Loss type over x,xxx | $x.xx” in each column
	- Other rows: put a small pink note saying “[Input type] x,xx | $x.xx” under column 2 (or 3/4/5)

### Outcome:

### Conclusion:
I didn't expect this much result from the texts I gave it, maybe it's because I am using my own account and it's remembering things across projects but this is nice to start with actually.
### Recommendation: 
If you can explain like this in detail what you imagine, I think Cursor is a good AI IDE and it's really amazing how much front-end result it is giving me, they are good as well. No perfect but like you said 75% is around the corner with this kind of approach.
