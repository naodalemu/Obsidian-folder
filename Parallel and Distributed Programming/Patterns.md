### **What are patterns?**
Patterns codify best practices in software engineering. In parallel programming, they help design algorithms by addressing task distribution and data access.
- Codifying best practice in SE
- task parallelization and data access standardization in parallel programming.

### **Why Do we use patterns**
- **Universality**: Independent of hardware or software(language)
- **Simplicity**: Provide a clear instruction for designing algorithms
- **Determinism**: Ensure repeatable results for easier testing and debugging because the problem of parallelism is determinism.
