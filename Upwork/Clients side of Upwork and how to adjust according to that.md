- On the profile overview the name should clearly state what the job wants, specialized profile is a must. for example: Expert Graphics Designer | UI and UX Designer | Wordpress Developer is a bit confusing. Is he a Graphics Designer or a Wordpress Developer. So this means each title should show a specific expression of the job we are applying to.
	- Create Specialized profiles
	- Name them only the specific job needed
		- Portfolio should be specific to profile
	- Make the general profile have everything
- [Question] - Why is it saying top 1% on relevant skill of the top rated plus girl (Okay wait a second. We found another dude that is not top rated plus so this 1% shit must be because of certificates)
- Boosted accounts are going to be above everyone
- Boosted proposals can also be best match and will be at the top
- Focus on Skills on your profile (maybe specific profile skills) and put the ones that really are common at the top.
- [Crazzzzy thing] - You can bold cover letters and make them reaaaaaaly stand out you know. Let's do that. [Focus Here]

- It would be an additional help (aygodam) to connect your portfolio item with Upwrok work history. Post the things you have done on Upwork and link them together.
- Upwork profile picture should be smiley and welcoming, Chill, cool, fun to work with guy.
