Hey Joshua, this project sounds really exciting. I know it can be hard to finding the right front-end developer that has all the skills you need and that is actually motivated to work closely with you, And that you can trust the job done RIGHT the FIRST time. I am not like most others who take on as many clients as they can, then run off and disappear for weeks at a time... Instead, I intentionally target a smaller, select group of clients that I can work closely with, so we can get the exact results you're looking for, without you having to struggle thorough it every step of the way. So if you are looking for a motivated, safe set of hands to take the weight of this project off your shoulders and work with you to get the job done RIGHT, then let's have a chat!

Here is how: Send me an Upwork message, then on upwork messages, click the green "Schedule a meeting" button, choose 45 mins and I'll confirm a time slot.

That way we can hop on a strategy call to discuss your project further and make sure we're a great fit together.

Looking forward!
Naod

P.S. - I did a bit of background research and I think your business is really great. This is an awesome opportunity to totally overhaul your website, and do a great job converting potential customers into actual sales. More to discuss on our call though!
