# 3rd Round Additional fixes
- Dashboard page semi circle image is missing
- In the dashboard "dashboard" section after we connect wallet the pagination for the table is missing so every transaction detail is listed all at once without any pagination.
- Cursor-pointer is not on any of the buttons in the site. I have to add it to all of the buttons all around the site for a better user experience.

# 4th Round fixes
- ![[Pasted image 20250321082614.png]] 
- Responsiveness on mobile is missing in dashboard
- "Increase on next phase" text is overlapping with token sold box. The increase on next phase text needs to me moved to the top.

# 5th fix
![[Pasted image 20250321103913.png]]
- When this phase gets to 100% it is not responsive and it pushes the page to the side, we need to make this better.
- In the dashboard page and dashboard tab, the disconnect button goes out of view on mobile.
