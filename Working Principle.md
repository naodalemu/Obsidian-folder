there are 3 ultrasonic devices, two in front at the edges, and one at the center front. From the 3 of them when one of them detects motion, the servo m motor will turn that way. For example if the detection range is 30 cm and when it detects motion from one of the ultrasonic devices, it will turn that way. There is a camera on the servo motor. Then the camera will try to detect an object and if it detects a human it will trigger the alarm. The detection will be handled using a usb with a pc and using pysera we will process the image using the camera and then we will send the signal to the Arduino then if there is a person it will trigger the alarm. The other one is temperature plus humidity, it detects temperature and starts the fan automatically. There is also a water sensor. When it rains it turns on an LED light. All the statuses will be printed on an LED screen at the front. When we come to power source, we have used solar panel on the roof so since the motor is high powered the power is not coming from Arduino but instead from the solar panel but it passes through a relay and we control the relay through Arduino. For the motor and the fan. In case we use a light system, we will also use the solar panel for it.
